# Orienteering Start clock synchronized to DCF77

Equity in sport is really a key point during the competition. In Orienteering competition, equity is not guaranteed. Start time is different for every category and for every racer in the category. The race start for a competitor is managed through a start clock, which has no synchronization with the race finish clock, managed by a punching system. As we all know, two clocks which are not synchronized will deviate from each other and will introduce uncertainty on the effective race time. The proposed project is trying to correct this problem by keeping the start clock to the absolute time delivered by the DCF77 signal.

## DCF77

DCF77 is a German longwave time signal and standard-frequency radio station. It
is controlled by the Physikalisch-Technische Bundesanstalt (PTB), Germany's national physics laboratory and transmits in continuous operation (24 hours). The highly accurate 77.5 kHz (3868.2897806 m wavelength) carrier signal is generated from local atomic clocks that are linked with the German master clocks at the PTB in Braunschweig. The DCF77 time signal is used for the dissemination of the German national legal time to the public. More here on [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DCF77).

### DCF77 receiver

Receivers are quite common, low cost and easy to operate.
